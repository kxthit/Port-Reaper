# Port-Reaper
"Port Reaper" is a basic python-based port scanner. 
The script is designed to identify any open ports on a target host by scanning all 65535 ports.
Utilizing the socket library, Port Reaper checks each port's status and maps common open ports to their associated protocols.

# Key Features:
Comprehensive Scanning: Scans the full range of ports (1-65535) to detect open ports.
Common port mapping: Identifies the protocol associated with common open ports using a built-in dictionary.
Real-Time Reporting: Displays open ports in real-time.
Error Handling: Gracefully manages interruptions and errors.
Scan Duration: Calculates and displays the total time taken for the scan.

# About This Project:
Port Reaper is my personal project developed for educational purposes and to explore network security concepts. The name "Port Reaper" is a creative designation i've chosen and does not carry any proprietary claims. The project draws from various references and resources to implement port scanning functionalities. No copyright is claimed over the name or the concept, and the tool is intended to be a practical resource for port scanning and network security.
